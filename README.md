Jess' Portfolio Site

Working on this project website, as well as my own, as I teach myself web development before attending College for the same.
As of December 11th I am comfortable with my knowledge so far of HTML and CSS to begin constructing display-worthy projects to showcase my progress.
With one month to go before classes begin, I have begun learning JavaScript to make my projects more dynamic and responsive, with my eyes set on a 
simple log-in authentication process as a first project involving JavaScript.
